# ProfileCard

This project is part of the Udemy course [30 Days of Angular: Build 30 Web Projects with Angular](https://www.udemy.com/course/30-days-of-angular/).

## Project Overview

ProfileCard is a simple Angular application that demonstrates how to build a modern, responsive profile card component using Angular. The project is designed as a hands-on exercise to help you practice Angular fundamentals, including component structure, styling with SCSS, and basic Angular CLI usage.

## Features

- Responsive profile card layout
- Modular Angular component structure
- SCSS styling for easy customization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
